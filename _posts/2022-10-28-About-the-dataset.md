### Induction Machine Parameters ###
The machine parameters are given below	
1. 220V / 380V	
2. 3.02A / 1.75A	
3. 4 poles	
4. 60Hz	
5. 4.1Nm Torque	
6. 1715 rpm	
7. Squirell cage rotor (34 bars)	

The bench of experiments is on the premises of the School of Engineering of São Carlos (EESC) of the University of São Paulo (USP), Brazil, more specifically in the Laboratory of Intelligent Automation of Processes and Systems (LAIPS) and Laboratory of Intelligent Control of Electrical Machines (LACIME).	

To simulate the failure of broken bars in the squirrel cage rotor of the three-phase induction motor it was necessary to drill the rotor. Drilling was carried out by means of a bench drill mounted with a 6 mm diameter drill to ensure that the diameter of the hole exceeds the width of a rotor bar, with the tip centered at half the longitudinal length of the rotor.
