## Principal Component Analysis (PCA)	
PCA finds a projection that captures the largest amount of variation in the data.	
The original data are projected onto a much smaller space, resulting in dimensionality reduction. We find the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix, and these eigenvectors define the new space.	

PCA was performed on the dataset after removing the transient component of the data of the BRB dataset.
